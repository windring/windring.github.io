Today is the first day of the holiday.
It's a busy day.
I spent a morning cleaning my bed room.
There are too many books which are used to belong to a little pupil and a junior middle school student on my booksheft,on my desk and under my bed.
Well,that's me.
Now I have to arrange them and put them in the suit place.
Tired but satisfied.

In the afternoon,I read so many pages to help me finish my own work.
I was so tired that I gave up the last item on the list.
